# Data

## [Caloric Suitability Index - CSI](https://ozak.github.io/Caloric-Suitability-Index/)
Agricultural suitability measured in terms of potential calories that can be produced given agro-climatic constraints. Introduced in [Galor and Ã–zak (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150020) and based on FAO GAEZ data. The [CSI website](https://ozak.github.io/Caloric-Suitability-Index/) provides downloads of various measures.


## [GAEZ v3.0](http://gaez.fao.org/)

Since the [FAO GAEZ](http://gaez.fao.org/) website has been down for over a year, and many people are trying to get the data, I am making all I have available here. The data is provided as is and is the original data as downloaded from that website sometime in 2013-2017.

## [Human Mobility Index - HMI](https://human-mobility-index.github.io/)
The [Human Mobility Index - HMI](https://human-mobility-index.github.io/) provides data to  estimate the potential minimum travel time across the globe (measured in hours) accounting for human biological constraints, as well as geographical and technological factors that determined travel time before the widespread use of steam power.
