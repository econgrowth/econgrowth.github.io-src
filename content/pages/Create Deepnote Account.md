<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Tip:</b> You can use your GMAIL  (Recommended) or personal email account. Then use your institutional <b>.EDU<b/> email account to verify your educational status (Select Education in the next screen) and get the free tools and account upgrades (See section after step 9). The only difference (as far as I can tell) is how you log in.

You can use all the notebooks on this website on Deepnote, by adding the [EconGrowthUG Workspace](https://deepnote.com/join-team?token=ef886be7ae3045c) to your account. You will not have editing privileges, but you will be able to copy notebooks to your **EconGrowthUG-My-Projects** Workspace, where you can edit and run code.

1. Log into your [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) account.
2. Follow [this link to the EconGrowthUG workspace](https://deepnote.com/join-team?token=ef886be7ae3045c).
3. Once you do this, you will be a Contributor to the course's workspace, i.e., you can view and run code I have prepared for you. Moreover, and more importantly, you can copy projects into your own workspace. If all went you should see two workspaces in your account.
