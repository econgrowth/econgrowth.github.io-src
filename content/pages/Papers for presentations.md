[Becker, S.O. and Ferrara, A., 2019. Consequences of forced migration: A survey of recent findings. Labour Economics, 59, pp.1-16.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2019.02.007)

**Abstract:**
Forced migration as a consequence of wars, civil conflicts, or natural disasters may have consequences different from those of voluntary migration. Recent work has highlighted the consequences of forced migration on receiving populations, on migrants themselves and on sending populations. We document findings from recent work, on education and other economic outcomes, but also on political outcomes. We summarize key lessons and point to gaps in the literature.

**Abstract:**
We study the long-run effects of forced migration on investment in education. After World War II, millions of Poles were forcibly uprooted from the Kresy territories of eastern Poland and resettled ( primarily) in the newly acquired Western Territories, from which the Germans were expelled. We combine historical censuses with newly collected survey data to show that, while there were no pre-WWII differences in educational attainment, Poles with a family history of forced migration are significantly more educated today than other Poles. These results are driven by a shift in preferences away from material possessions toward investment in human capital.

**Abstract:**
This article examines the long-run effects of forced migration on economic development in the origin economy, using Czechoslovakia’s expulsion of three million Germans after WWII. For identification, I use the discontinuity in ethnic composition at the border of the Sudetenland region where Germans lived. Germans had similar characteristics to Czechs, bypassing factors driving effects in other cases of forced migration, such as differences in human capital. The expulsion produced persistent disparities in population density, sector composition and educational attainment. I trace effects to selective initial resettlements and capital extraction following the expulsion, culminating in urban decay and human capital decline.

[Bazzi, Samuel, Arya Gaduh, Alexander D. Rothenberg, and Maisy Wong. 2016. "Skill Transferability, Migration, and Development: Evidence from Population Resettlement in Indonesia." American Economic Review, 106 (9): 2658-98.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20141781)

**Abstract:**
We use a natural experiment in Indonesia to provide causal evidence on the role of location-specific human capital and skill transferability in shaping the spatial distribution of productivity. From 1979-1988, the Transmigration Program relocated two million migrants from rural Java and Bali to new rural settlements in the Outer Islands. Villages assigned migrants from regions with more similar agroclimatic endowments exhibit higher rice productivity and nighttime light intensity one to two decades later. We find some evidence of migrants' adaptation to agroclimatic change. Overall, our results suggest that regional productivity differences may overstate the potential gains from migration.

**Abstract:**
We use a population resettlement program in Indonesia to identify long-run effects of intergroup contact on national integration. In the 1980s, the government relocated two million ethnically diverse migrants into hundreds of new communities. We find greater integration in fractionalized communities with many small groups, as measured by national language use at home, intermarriage, and children's name choices. However, in polarized communities with a few large groups, ethnic attachment increases and integration declines. Residential segregation dampens these effects. Social capital, public goods, and ethnic conflict follow similar patterns. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of localized contact in shaping identity.

[Miho, Antonela and Jarotschkin, Alexandra and Zhuravskaya, Ekaterina, Diffusion of Gender Norms: Evidence from Stalin's Ethnic Deportations (June 1, 2019).](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3417682)

**Abstract:**
We study horizontal between-group cultural transmission using a unique historical setting, which combines exogenous group exposure with no control over how and whether the representatives of different groups interact. Stalin’s ethnic deportations during WWII moved over 2 million people --- the majority of whom were ethnic Germans and Chechens --- from the Western parts of the USSR to Central Asia and Siberia. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations was exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms. Combining historical archival data with contemporary surveys, we document that gender norms diffused from deportees to the local population, resulting in changes in attitudes and behavior. Norms of gender equality diffused more than norms of gender discrimination. Identification relies on the fact that, within subnational regions, the local population was fairly homogeneous, while deportation destinations were determined by local demands for manual labor, orthogonal to identity and skills of deportees, making the variation in the group composition of the deportations across destination localities exogenous, conditional on the deportation size and region fixed effects.

[Taylor, J.E., Filipski, M.J., Alloush, M., Gupta, A., Valdes, R.I.R. and Gonzalez-Estrada, E., 2016. Economic impact of refugees. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(27), pp.7449-7453.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1604566113)

**Abstract:**
In 2015, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees accommodated over 15 million refugees, mostly in refugee camps in developing countries. The World Food Program provided these refugees with food aid, in cash or in kind. Refugees’ impacts on host countries are controversial and little understood. This unique study analyzes the economic impacts of refugees on host-country economies within a 10-km radius of three Congolese refugee camps in Rwanda. Simulations using Monte Carlo methods reveal that cash aid to refugees creates significant positive income spillovers to host-country businesses and households. An additional adult refugee receiving cash aid increases annual real income in the local economy by $205 to $253, significantly more than the $120–$126 in aid each refugee receives. Trade between the local economy and the rest of Rwanda increases by $49 to $55. The impacts are lower for in-kind food aid, a finding relevant to development aid generally.

[Toews, G. and Vezina, P.L., 2020. Enemies of the people.](https://osf.io/gnypr/download)

**Abstract:**
Enemies of the people were the millions of artists, engineers, professors, and affluent peasants that were thought a threat to the Soviet regime for being the educated elite, and were forcedly resettled to the Gulag, i.e. the system of forced labor camps across the Soviet Union. In this paper we look at the long-run consequences of this dark re-location episode. We show that areas around camps with a larger share of enemies among camp prisoners are more prosperous today, as captured by firms’ wages and profits, as well as night lights per capita. We also show that the descendants of enemies are more likely to be tertiary educated today. Our results point in the direction of a long-run persistence of education and a resulting positive effect on local economic outcomes. A 28 percentage point increase in the share of enemies increases night lights per capita by 58%, profits per employee by 65%, and average wages by 22%.

[Chiovelli, G., Michalopoulos, S., Papaioannou, E. and Sequeira, S., 2021. Forced Displacement and Human Capital: Evidence from Separated Siblings (No. w29589). National Bureau of Economic Research.](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29589/w29589.pdf)

**Abstract:**
We examine the impact of conflict-driven displacement on human capital. We focus on the Mozambican civil war (1977–1992), during which more than four million civilians fled to the countryside, cities, and refugee camps and settlements in neighboring countries. We leverage the full post-war census to compare siblings separated during the war, using those who stayed behind as a counterfactual to one’s displacement path. Uprooted children register higher investments in education. Second, we quantify the relative importance of place-based and displacement effects. The latter increases education and decreases attachment to agriculture by the same rate as being exposed to an environment approximately one standard deviation more developed than one’s birthplace. Third, we conduct a survey in Nampula, whose population doubled during the civil war. Those who fled to the city have significantly higher education than their siblings who remained in the countryside and they converged to the levels of schooling of non-mover urban-born individuals. However, those displaced exhibit significantly lower social/civic capital and have worse mental health, even three decades after the war. These findings reveal that displacement shocks can trigger human capital investments, breaking links with subsistence agriculture, but at the cost of long-lasting, social, and psychological traumas.

[Lu, F., Siddiqui, S. and Bharadwaj, P., 2021. Marriage outcomes of displaced women. Journal of Development Economics, 152, p.102684.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102684)

**Abstract:**
To learn more about the long-term consequences of displacement on women, we examine the marriage market outcomes of forcibly displaced women. Using data from 12 representative surveys in 7 countries, we document that women who are adolescents at the time of displacement are more likely to be married. This pattern is robust to choice of comparison group and across countries. We do not find this pattern for displaced adolescent men. We provide additional evidence on this relationship by using unique features of the partition of India in 1947, an event which resulted in large-scale bilateral displacement between India and newly formed Pakistan. Specifically, we use the plausibly exogenous timing and the arbitrary nature of the border drawing to motivate a difference-in-difference design. Using a representative household survey collected in 1973, we find that women who were adolescents when they were displaced by partition were significantly more likely to marry earlier, in line with the descriptive cross country evidence. These women were less likely to continue their education and had more children overall, but do not appear to have married spouses with worse observable characteristics.

[Donaldson, D., 2018. Railroads of the Raj: Estimating the impact of transportation infrastructure. American Economic Review, 108(4-5), pp.899-934.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20101199)

**Abstract:**
How large are the benefits of transportation infrastructure projects, and what explains these benefits? This paper uses archival data from colonial India to investigate the impact of India's vast railroad network. Guided by four results from a general equilibrium trade model, I find that railroads: (1) decreased trade costs and interregional price gaps; (2) increased interregional and international trade; (3) increased real income levels; and (4) that a sufficient statistic for the effect of railroads on welfare in the model accounts well for the observed reduced-form impact of railroads on real income in the data.

**Abstract:**
This article examines the historical impact of railroads on the U.S. economy, with a focus on quantifying the aggregate impact on the agricultural sector in 1890. Expansion of the railroad network may have affected all counties directly or indirectly—an econometric challenge that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on each county is captured by changes in that county’s “market access,” a reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory. We measure counties’ market access by constructing a network database of railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in 1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land by 60%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country roads.

[Storeygard, A., 2016. Farther on down the road: transport costs, trade and urban growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The Review of economic studies, 83(3), pp.1263-1295.](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw020)

**Abstract:**
This article investigates the role of intercity transport costs in determining the income of sub-Saharan African cities. In particular, focusing on fifteen countries whose largest city is a port, I find that an oil price increase of the magnitude experienced between 2002 and 2008 induces the income of cities near that port to increase by 7% relative to otherwise identical cities 500 km farther away. Combined with external estimates, this implies an elasticity of city economic activity with respect to transport costs of −0.28 at 500 km from the port. Moreover, the effect differs by the surface of roads between cities. Cities connected to the port by paved roads are chiefly affected by transport costs to the port, while cities connected to the port by unpaved roads are more affected by connections to secondary centres.

**Abstract:**
This paper estimates the effect of access to transportation networks on regional economic outcomes in China over a twenty-year period of rapid income growth. It addresses the problem of the endogenous placement of networks by exploiting the fact that these networks tend to connect historical cities. Our results show that proximity to transportation networks have a moderately sized positive causal effect on per capita GDP levels across sectors, but no effect on per capita GDP growth. We provide a simple theoretical framework with empirically testable predictions to interpret our results. We argue that our results are consistent with factor mobility playing an important role in determining the economic benefits of infrastructure development.

**Abstract:**
Nearly one billion people worldwide live in rural areas without access to national paved road networks. We estimate the impacts of India's 40 billion USD national rural road construction program using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and comprehensive household and firm census microdata. Four years after road construction, the main effect of new feeder roads is to facilitate the movement of workers out of agriculture. However, there are no major changes in agricultural outcomes, income, or assets. Employment in village firms expands only slightly. Even with better market connections, remote areas may continue to lack economic opportunities.

[Treb Allen, Dave Donaldson: "Persistence and Path Dependence in the Spatial Economy"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28059)

**Abstract:**
How much of the spatial distribution of economic activity today is determined by history rather than by geographic fundamentals? And if history matters for the distribution, does it also affect overall efficiency? This paper develops a tractable theoretical and empirical framework that aims to provide answers to these questions. We derive conditions on the strength of agglomeration externalities, valid for any geography, under which temporary historical shocks can have extremely persistent effects and even permanent consequences (path dependence). We also obtain new analytical expressions, functions of the particular geography in question, that bound the aggregate welfare level that can be sustained in any steady-state, thereby bounding the potential impact of history. Our simulations—based on parameters estimated from spatial variation across US counties from 1800-2000—imply that small variations in historical conditions have substantial consequences for both the spatial distribution and the efficiency of US economic activity, both today and in the long-run.

**Abstract:**
Previous work on transportation investments has focused on average impacts in high- and middle-income countries. We estimate average and heterogeneous effects in a poor continent, Africa, using roads and cities data spanning 50 years in 39 countries. Using changes in market access due to distant road construction as a source of exogenous variation, we estimate a 30-year elasticity of city population with respect to market access of about 0.08–0.13. Our results suggest that this elasticity is stronger for small and remote cities, and weaker in politically favored and agriculturally suitable areas. Access to foreign cities besides international ports matters little. Additional evidence points suggestively to rural-to-urban migration as the primary source of this population increase, though we cannot fully rule out natural increase or reallocation across cities.

**Abstract:**

We estimate the effect of interstate highways on the level and composition of trade for US cities. Highways within cities have a large effect on the weight of city exports with an elasticity of approximately 0.5. We find little effect of highways on the total value of exports. Consistent with this, we find that cities with more highways specialize in sectors producing heavy goods.

[Faber, B., 2014. Trade integration, market size, and industrialization: evidence from China's National Trunk Highway System. Review of Economic Studies, 81(3), pp.1046-1070.](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdu010)

**Abstract:**
Large-scale transport infrastructure investments connect both large metropolitan centres of production as well as small peripheral regions. Are the resulting trade cost reductions a force for the diffusion of industrial and total economic activity to peripheral regions, or do they reinforce the concentration of production in space? This article exploits China's National Trunk Highway System as a large-scale natural experiment to contribute to our understanding of this question. The network was designed to connect provincial capitals and cities with an urban population above 500,000. As a side effect, a large number of small peripheral counties were connected to large metropolitan agglomerations. To address non-random route placements on the way between targeted city nodes, I propose an instrumental variable strategy based on the construction of least cost path spanning tree networks. The estimation results suggest that network connections have led to a reduction in GDP growth among non-targeted peripheral counties. This effect appears to be driven by a significant reduction in industrial output growth. Additional results present evidence in support of a trade-based channel in the light of falling trade costs between peripheral and metropolitan regions.

[Roland 2020: " The Deep Historical Roots of Modern Culture: A Comparative Perspective"](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/JCE2020.pdf). [Data appendix with explanation of all the scores](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/JCE2020DATA.pdf)

**Abstract:**
This paper presents evidence showing that there have been since antiquity two opposed types of institutional systems: one resembling central planning and present in ancient China, ancient Egypt, the Inca Empire and other territorial states, and another one with strong market institutions, protection of property rights present mostly in city-states, not just in the Mediterranean but throughout the world. Evidence is presented that these institutional differences dating back to the antiquity are shaped by special geographical conditions. These institutional differences can be seen to be at the root of the two cultural systems in today's world: individualism and collectivism. These cultural differences have effects on economic performance and institutions in today's world.

[Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011): "Understanding the Individualism-Collectivism Cleavage and its Effects: Lessons from Cultural Psychology"](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~groland/pubs/IEA%20papervf.pdf)

**Abstract:**
This  paper presents  a  survey  of  the  literature  on culture  in economics, emphasizing the  effects  of  culture  as  well  as  the  origins  of  cultural  development. Research finds  culture  to have  a  large  set  of  effects  on economic  behaviors, outcomes  and   formal  institutions. A  large  body of  research finds  culture  to be  slow-moving. Our understanding of  the  determinants  of  cultural  change  and cultural  diversity are  still  quite partial. Development  policies  should be  adapted to existing cultures  without  trying to change  them.

**Abstract:**
We argue that a more individualist culture leads to more innovation and to higher growth because of the social status rewards associated with innovation in that culture. We use data on the frequency of particular genes associated with collectivist cultures, as well as a measure of distance in terms of frequencies of blood types, and historic prevalence of pathogens to instrument individualism scores. The relationship between individualism and innovation/growth remains strong even after controlling for institutions and other potentially confounding factors. We also provide evidence consistent with two-way causality between culture and institutions.

[Davis, L. S., & Williamson, C. R. (2019). "Does individualism promote gender equality?. World Development, 123, 104627.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104627)

**Abstract:**
We argue that individualism promotes gender equality. Individualist values of autonomy and self-determination transcend gender identities and serve to legitimize women’s goals and choices. In contrast, collectivist values may subordinate women’s personal goals to their social obligations, generating greater acceptance of gender inequality. Using individual level data from World Values Surveys, we find that individualism is significantly associated with support for gender equal attitudes regarding employment, income, education, and political leadership. Individualism is also associated with greater levels of female employment and educational attainment, and lower levels of fertility. These results are robust to controlling for income, education, religion, historical plough use, gendered language, and country-time fixed effects. Our within country analysis allows us to isolate the impact of individualism from other confounding effects. Using historical rainfall variation as an instrument for individualism, we find that the exogenous portion of individualism reduces support for patriarchal attitudes and fertility, and it increases female employment and educational attainment. These effects are economically large. We address concerns over instrumental validity by controlling for a variety of factors, including historical plough use, religious affiliation, religiosity, social trust, average rainfall levels, distance from the equator, cool-water conditions, agricultural suitability, historical political and economic development, and the presence of large animals. This paper contributes to a mounting body of evidence suggesting a key role for highly persistent cultural norms and values in determining gender inequality, the gender division of labor, and economic and social outcomes for women.

[Bazzi, Fiszbein, and Gebresilasse (Ecca, 2020). Frontier culture: The roots and persistence of “rugged individualism” in the United States](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA16484)

**Abstract:**
The presence of a westward-moving frontier of settlement shaped early U.S. history. In 1893, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner famously argued that the American frontier fostered individualism. We investigate the “frontier thesis” and identify its long-run implications for culture and politics. We track the frontier throughout the 1790–1890 period and construct a novel, county-level measure of total frontier experience (TFE). Historically, frontier locations had distinctive demographics and greater individualism. Long after the closing of the frontier, counties with greater TFE exhibit more pervasive individualism and opposition to redistribution. This pattern cuts across known divides in the United States, including urban–rural and north–south. We provide evidence on the roots of frontier culture, identifying both selective migration and a causal effect of frontier exposure on individualism. Overall, our findings shed new light on the frontier's persistent legacy of rugged individualism.

[Knudsen, A.S.B., 2019. "Those Who Stayed: Individualism, Self-Selection and Cultural Change during the Age of Mass Migration. Self-Selection and Cultural Change During the Age of Mass Migration](https://annesofiebeckknudsen.com/thosewhostayed/)

**Abstract:**
This paperstudies the cultural determinants and consequences of mass emigration from Scandinavia to North America in the 19th century. I test the hypothesis that people with collectivist traits tended to stay rather than emigrate because they faced higher costs of leaving familiar social networks behind. Exploiting near-complete data on 1.5 million emigrants and 10 million stayers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, I find that children who grew up in households that practiced stronger collectivist norms were less likely to emigrate later in life. I proceed to documentthatthistypeofselectiveemigrationgeneratedlastingcultural change in migrant-sending locations. Locations that experienced larger outflows of particularly selected individuals are thus more collectivist today. The implications of these findings are potentially wide-reaching as collectivism and its counterpart, individualism, have been linked to central societal processes such as cooperation, the diffusion of ideas, and innovation.

[Stelios Michalopoulos, Melanie Meng Xue (QJE, 2021): "Folklore"](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab003)

**Abstract:**
Folklore is the collection of traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community passed through the generations by word of mouth. We introduce to economics a unique catalog of oral traditions spanning approximately 1,000 societies. After validating the catalog’s content by showing that the groups’ motifs reflect known geographic and social attributes, we present two sets of applications. First, we illustrate how to fill in the gaps and expand upon a group’s ethnographic record, focusing on political complexity, high gods, and trade. Second, we discuss how machine learning and human classification methods can help shed light on cultural traits, using gender roles, attitudes toward risk, and trust as examples. Societies with tales portraying men as dominant and women as submissive tend to relegate their women to subordinate positions in their communities, both historically and today. More risk-averse and less entrepreneurial people grew up listening to stories wherein competitions and challenges are more likely to be harmful than beneficial. Communities with low tolerance toward antisocial behavior, captured by the prevalence of tricksters being punished, are more trusting and prosperous today. These patterns hold across groups, countries, and second-generation immigrants. Overall, the results highlight the significance of folklore in cultural economics, calling for additional applications.

**Abstract:**
We examine the golden age of U.S. innovation by undertaking a major data collection exercise linking historical U.S. patents to state and county-level aggregates and matching inventors to Federal Censuses between 1880 and 1940. We identify a causal relationship between patented inventions and long-run economic growth and outline a basic framework for analyzing key macro and micro-level determinants. We find a positive relationship between innovation and drivers of regional performance including population density, financial development and geographic connectedness. We also explore the impact of social structure measured by slavery and religion. We then profile the characteristics of inventors and their life cycle finding that inventors were highly educated, positively selected through exit early in their careers, made time allocation decisions such as delayed marriage, and tended to migrate to places that were conducive to innovation. Father's income was positively correlated with becoming an inventor, though not when controlling for the child's education. We show there were strong financial returns to technological development. Finally, we document an inverted-U shaped relationship between inequality and innovation but also show that innovative places tended to be more socially mobile. Our new data help to address important questions related to innovation and long-run growth dynamics.

[Moretti, E., 2021. The effect of high-tech clusters on the productivity of top inventors. American Economic Review, 111(10), pp.3328-75.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20191277)

**Abstract:**
The high-tech sector is concentrated in a small number of cities. The ten largest clusters in computer science, semiconductors, and biology account for 69 percent, 77 percent, and 59 percent of all US inventors, respectively. Using longitudinal data on 109,846 inventors, I find that geographical agglomeration results in significant productivity gains. When an inventor moves to a city with a large cluster of inventors in the same field, she experiences a sizable increase in the number and quality of patents produced. The presence of significant productivity externalities implies that the agglomeration of inventors generates large gains in the aggregate amount of innovation produced in the United States.

[Michael Stuetzer, Abel Brodeur, Martin Obschonka, David Audretsch, Peter J. Rentfrow, Jeff Potter, Samuel D. Gosling: "A Golden Opportunity: The Gold Rush, Entrepreneurship and Culture"](https://docs.iza.org/dp14894.pdf)

**Abstract:**
We study the origins of entrepreneurship (culture) in the United States. For the analysis we make use of a quasi-natural experiment – the gold rush in the second part of the 19th century. We argue that the presence of gold attracted individuals with entrepreneurial personality traits. Due to a genetic founder effect and the formation of an entrepreneurship culture, we expect gold rush counties to have higher entrepreneurship rates. The analysis shows that gold rush counties indeed have higher entrepreneurship rates from 1910, when records began, until the present as well as a higher prevalence of entrepreneurial traits in the populace.

[Jun Yeong Lee, John V. Winters: "Too Cold to Venture There? January Temperature and Immigrant Self-Employment across the United States"](https://docs.iza.org/dp14941.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Immigrant entrepreneurs are critical to regional and national economies. Immigrants in the USA have higher self-employment rates than natives, and immigrants have made outsized contributions as founders of numerous highly successful firms. However, we document that immigrant self-employment rates vary considerably across areas of the USA. Our main measure is the percentage of immigrant workers in an area who are self-employed; i.e., the self- employment rate for the foreign-born. Areas with colder winter temperatures have especially low self-employment rates among their immigrant populations compared to other areas of the USA. This relationship holds for numerous sub-samples of immigrants and is not driven by any particular group. The relationship persists after controlling for numerous individual and local area characteristics. Immigrant entrepreneurs appear to be especially forward-looking and responsive to warmer January temperature as a locational amenity. The results have important implications about the location choices of immigrant entrepreneurs.

[Guido Tabellini and Michel Serafinelli: "Creativity over Time and Space"](https://repec.cepr.org/repec/cpr/ceprdp/DP12365.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Creativity is often highly concentrated in time and space, and across different domains. What explains the formation and decay of clusters of creativity? We match data on notable individuals born in Europe between the 11th and the 19th century with historical city data. The production and attraction of creative talent is associated with city institutions that protected economic and political freedoms and promoted local autonomy. Instead, indicators of local economic conditions such as city size and real wages, do not predict creative clusters. We also show that famous creatives are spatially concentrated and clustered across disciplines, that their spatial mobility has remained stable over the centuries, and that creative clusters are persistent but less than population.

[Glaeser, Kerr, and Kerr: "Entrepreneurship and Urban Growth: An Empirical Assessment with Historical Mines"](https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00456)

**Abstract:**
We study entrepreneurship and growth through the lens of U.S. cities. Initial entrepreneurship correlates strongly with urban employment growth, but endogeneity bedevils interpretation. Chinitz (1961) hypothesized that coal mines near cities led to specialization in industries, like steel, with significant scale economies and that those big firms subsequently damped entrepreneurship across several generations. Proximity to historical mining deposits is associated with reduced entrepreneurship for cities in the 1970s and onward in industries unrelated to mining. We use historical mines as an instrument for our modern entrepreneurship measures and find a persistent link between entrepreneurship and city employment growth.

[Kerr, William R., Ramana Nanda, and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf. 2014. "Entrepreneurship as Experimentation."](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.28.3.25)

**Abstract:**
Entrepreneurship research is on the rise but many questions about the fundamental nature of entrepreneurship still exist. We argue that entrepreneurship is about experimentation; the probabilities of success are low, extremely skewed, and unknowable until an investment is made. At a macro level, experimentation by new firms underlies the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction. However, at a micro level, investment and continuation decisions are not always made in a competitive Darwinian contest. Instead, a few investors make decisions that are impacted by incentive, agency, and coordination problems, often before a new idea even has a chance to compete in a market. We contend that costs and constraints on the ability to experiment alter the type of organizational form surrounding innovation and influence when innovation is more likely to occur. These factors not only govern how much experimentation is undertaken in the economy, but also the trajectory of experimentation, with potentially very deep economic consequences.

[Kerr, Kerr, and Xu: "Personality Traits of Entrepreneurs: A Review of Recent Literature"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0300000080)

**Abstract:**
We review the extensive literature since 2000 on the personality traits of entrepreneurs. We first consider baseline personality traits like the Big-5 model, self-efficacy and innovativeness, locus of control, and the need for achievement. We then consider risk attitudes and goals and aspirations of entrepreneurs. Within each area, we separate studies by the type of entrepreneurial behavior considered: entry into entrepreneurship, performance outcomes, and exit from entrepreneurship. This literature shows common results and many points of disagreement, reflective of the heterogeneous nature of entrepreneurship. We label studies by the type of entrepreneurial population studied (e.g., Main Street vs. those backed by venture capital) to identify interesting and irreducible parts of this heterogeneity, while also identifying places where we anticipate future large-scale research and the growing depth of the field are likely to clarify matters. There are many areas, like how firm performance connects to entrepreneurial personality, that are woefully understudied and ripe for major advances if the appropriate cross-disciplinary ingredients are assembled.

**Abstract:**
There is a growing body of evidence that many entrepreneurs seem to enter and persist in entrepreneurship despite earning low risk-adjusted returns. This has lead to attempts to provide explanations—using both standard economic theory and behavioral economics—for why certain individuals may be attracted to such an apparently unprofitable activity. Drawing on research in behavioral economics, in the sections that follow, we review three sets of possible interpretations for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in, entrepreneurship. Differences in risk aversion provide a plausible and intuitive interpretation of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, a growing literature has begun to highlight the potential importance of overconfidence in driving entrepreneurial outcomes. Such a mechanism may appear at face value to work like a lower level of risk aversion, but there are clear conceptual differences—in particular, overconfidence likely arises from behavioral biases and misperceptions of probability distributions. Finally, nonpecuniary taste-based factors may be important in motivating both the decisions to enter into and to persist in entrepreneurship.

**Abstract:**
We document that individuals who grow up in high firm density areas are more likely to become entrepreneurs, given firm density in their current location, and to run businesses in the sector with the highest density when young. Firm density at an entrepreneur’s young age drives current firm profitability and is more important than current density for business performance. Results hold in a sample of movers, which allows addressing endogeneity concerns. These results are consistent with entrepreneurial skills being partly learnable through social contacts. Accordingly, entrepreneurs who grow up in high firm density areas adopt better managerial practices.

**Abstract:**
We investigate how perceived parents’ performance in entrepreneurship (PPE) affects the entrepreneurial career intentions of offspring. We argue that while perceived PPE enhances offspring’s perceived entrepreneurial desirability and feasibility because of exposure mechanisms, it inhibits the translation of both desirability and feasibility perceptions into entrepreneurial career intentions due to upward social comparison mechanisms. Thus, perceived PPE acts as a double-edged sword for the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship. Our predictions are tested and confirmed on a sample of 21,895 individuals from 33 countries. This study advances the literature on intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship by providing a foundation for understanding the social psychological conditions necessary for such transmission to occur.

**Abstract:**
Despite the consensus that entrepreneurship runs in the family, we lack evidence regarding the total importance of family and community background, as well as the relative importance of different background influences that affect entrepreneurship. We draw on human capital formation theories to argue that families and communities provide a salient context for the development of individual entrepreneurial skills and preferences, beyond the existing focus on parental entrepreneurship. We posit that early influences are more important than later influences and propose a hierarchy of family influences, whereby genes have the largest explanatory power, followed by parental entrepreneurship, neighborhoods, and parental resources, and finally by parental immigration, family structure, and sibling peers. Finally, we argue that the higher human and financial capital intensity of incorporated relative to unincorporated entrepreneurship predictably alters the hierarchy of family influences, as does gender. Sibling correlations estimated on Swedish register data confirm our hypotheses.

[Sara Lowes, Eduardo Montero: "Concessions, Violence, and Indirect Rule: Evidence from the Congo Free State"](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab021)

**Abstract:**
All colonial powers granted concessions to private companies to extract natural resources during the colonial era. In Africa, these concessions were characterized by indirect rule and violence. We use the arbitrarily defined borders of rubber concessions granted in the north of the Congo Free State to examine the causal effects of this form of economic organization on development. We find that historical exposure to the concessions causes significantly worse education, wealth, and health outcomes. To examine mechanisms, we collect survey and experimental data from individuals near a former concession boundary. We find that village chiefs inside the former concessions provide fewer public goods, are less likely to be elected, and are more likely to be hereditary. However, individuals in the concessions are more trusting, more cohesive, and more supportive of sharing income. We interpret our results as reflecting how institutions and culture may act as substitutes in the context of the widespread colonial concession system.

[Leander Heldring, James A Robinson, Sebastian Vollmer: "The Long-Run Impact of the Dissolution of the English Monasteries"](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab030)

**Abstract:**
We use the effect of the Dissolution of the English Monasteries after 1535 to test the commercialization hypothesis about the roots of long-run English economic development. Before the Dissolution, monastic lands were relatively unencumbered by inefficient feudal land tenure but could not be sold. The Dissolution created a market for formerly monastic lands, which could now be more effectively commercialized relative to nonmonastic lands, where feudal tenure persisted until the twentieth century. We show that parishes affected by the Dissolution subsequently experienced a rise of the gentry and had more innovation and higher yield in agriculture, a greater share of the population working outside of agriculture, and ultimately higher levels of industrialization. Our results are consistent with explanations of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions which emphasize the commercialization of society as a key precondition for taking advantage of technological change and new economic opportunities.

[Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Mark Koyama, Youhong Lin, Tuan-Hwee Sng: "The Fractured-Land Hypothesis"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Fractured_Land.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Patterns of political unification and fragmentation have crucial implications for
comparative economic development. Diamond (1997) famously argued that “fractured
land” was responsible for China’s tendency toward political unification and Europe’s
protracted political fragmentation. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical
information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural
land to quantitatively gauge the effects of “fractured land” on state formation in Eurasia.
We find that either topography or productive land alone is sufficient to account for China’s
recurring political unification and Europe’s persistent political fragmentation. The existence
of a core region of high land productivity in Northern China plays a central role in our
simulations. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes and assess
how robust our findings are.

**Abstract:**
We test the impact of religiosity on the transition to modern growth. In lack of surveys, we develop a novel measure of religiosity based on the idea that given names reveal preferences and identities of parents, including their religious identity. For validity, we document that individuals who share first name with a major religious figure engage in more religious behaviors, reflected in their choice of studies and professions, loyalty towards the church, and their response to natural disasters. We do so using data for 10,000s of university students in the Holy Roman Empire and 100,000s of authors active during the past 700 years. We proceed to document that individuals with religious first names are less likely to become engineers, doctors, and scientists, or to move on to advanced studies within university. In line with a literature on the crucial role of science and knowledge for the transition to modern growth, we last document that cities across Europe inhabited by more religious individuals grew slower than other cities. To establish causality, we rely on the fact thatparental naming practices are independent of choices made by their offspring and we comparevery similar individuals (authors or medieval university students), born at the same time in the same area. Our results contribute to a growing literature on societal impacts of religiosity.

[Felix Koenig: "Technical Change and Superstar Effects: Evidence from the Rollout of Television"](https://docs.iza.org/dp14978.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Technical change that extends market scale can generate winner-take-all dynamics, with large income growth among top earners. I test this "superstar model" in the entertainer labor market, where the historic rollout of television creates a natural experiment in scale-related technological change. The resulting inequality changes are consistent with superstar theory: the launch of a local TV station skews the entertainer wage distribution sharply to the right, with the biggest impact at the very top of the distribution, while negatively impacting workers below the star level. The findings provide evidence of superstar effects and distinguish such effects from popular alternative models.

[Ross Levine, Chen Lin, Chicheng Ma, Yuchen Xu: "The Legal Origins of Financial Development: Evidence from the Shanghai Concessions"](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3955335)

**Abstract:**
The key challenge to assessing the legal origins view of financial development is identifying exogenous changes in legal systems. We assemble new data on the British and French concessions in Shanghai between 1845 and 1936. Two regime changes altered the degree to which the British common and French civil law held jurisdiction over their respective concessions. By examining the changing application of different legal traditions to adjacent neighborhoods within the same city, we discover evidence consistent with the legal origins view: the financial development advantage in the British concession widened after Western legal jurisdiction intensified and narrowed after it abated.

[David Levine, Salvatore Modica: "Survival of the Weakest: Why the West Rules"](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3999221)

**Abstract:** We study a model of institutions that evolve through conflict. We find that one of three configurations can emerge: an extractive hegemony, a balance of power between extractive societies or a balance of power between inclusive societies - the latter being most conducive to innovation. As extractive societies are assumed to have an advantage in head to head confrontations we refer to this latter possibility as the survival of the weakest. Our contention is that the reason that the West “rules” can be traced back to two events both taking place in China: the invention of the cannon, which made possible the survival of the weakest in Europe; and the arrival of Genghis Khan, which led to the survival of the strongest in China. div.abstract

[Remi Jedwab, Marina Gindelsky: "Killer Cities and Industrious Cities? New Data and Evidence on 250 Years of Urban Growth"](http://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:gwi:wpaper:2022-01&r=&r=gro)

**Abstract:**	In the historical literature, cities of the Industrial Revolution are portrayed as having a demographic penalty: killer cities with high death rates and industrious cities with low birth rates. To econometrically test this, we construct a novel data set of almost 2,000 crude demographic rates for 142 large cities in 35 countries for 1700-1950. Mortality actually decreased faster than fertility during the Industrial Revolution era and rates of natural increase rose in the cities of industrializing countries, especially large cities. This implies a declining, not rising, demographic penalty thanks to the Industrial Revolution. To explain the puzzle, we posit that negative health and industriousness effects of industrial urbanization might have been outweighed by positive effects of increased income and life expectancy.
