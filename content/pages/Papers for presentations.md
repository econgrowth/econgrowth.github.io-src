[Stelios Michalopoulos, Melanie Meng Xue: Folklore](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab003)

Abstract:
Folklore is the collection of traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community passed through the generations by word of mouth. We introduce to economics a unique catalog of oral traditions spanning approximately 1,000 societies. After validating the catalog’s content by showing that the groups’ motifs reflect known geographic and social attributes, we present two sets of applications. First, we illustrate how to fill in the gaps and expand upon a group’s ethnographic record, focusing on political complexity, high gods, and trade. Second, we discuss how machine learning and human classification methods can help shed light on cultural traits, using gender roles, attitudes toward risk, and trust as examples. Societies with tales portraying men as dominant and women as submissive tend to relegate their women to subordinate positions in their communities, both historically and today. More risk-averse and less entrepreneurial people grew up listening to stories wherein competitions and challenges are more likely to be harmful than beneficial. Communities with low tolerance toward antisocial behavior, captured by the prevalence of tricksters being punished, are more trusting and prosperous today. These patterns hold across groups, countries, and second-generation immigrants. Overall, the results highlight the significance of folklore in cultural economics, calling for additional applications.

[Sara Lowes, Eduardo Montero: Concessions, Violence, and Indirect Rule: Evidence from the Congo Free State](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab021)

Abstract:
All colonial powers granted concessions to private companies to extract natural resources during the colonial era. In Africa, these concessions were characterized by indirect rule and violence. We use the arbitrarily defined borders of rubber concessions granted in the north of the Congo Free State to examine the causal effects of this form of economic organization on development. We find that historical exposure to the concessions causes significantly worse education, wealth, and health outcomes. To examine mechanisms, we collect survey and experimental data from individuals near a former concession boundary. We find that village chiefs inside the former concessions provide fewer public goods, are less likely to be elected, and are more likely to be hereditary. However, individuals in the concessions are more trusting, more cohesive, and more supportive of sharing income. We interpret our results as reflecting how institutions and culture may act as substitutes in the context of the widespread colonial concession system.

[Leander Heldring, James A Robinson, Sebastian Vollmer: The Long-Run Impact of the Dissolution of the English Monasteries](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjab030)

Abstract:
We use the effect of the Dissolution of the English Monasteries after 1535 to test the commercialization hypothesis about the roots of long-run English economic development. Before the Dissolution, monastic lands were relatively unencumbered by inefficient feudal land tenure but could not be sold. The Dissolution created a market for formerly monastic lands, which could now be more effectively commercialized relative to nonmonastic lands, where feudal tenure persisted until the twentieth century. We show that parishes affected by the Dissolution subsequently experienced a rise of the gentry and had more innovation and higher yield in agriculture, a greater share of the population working outside of agriculture, and ultimately higher levels of industrialization. Our results are consistent with explanations of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions which emphasize the commercialization of society as a key precondition for taking advantage of technological change and new economic opportunities.

[Michael Stuetzer, Abel Brodeur, Martin Obschonka, David Audretsch, Peter J. Rentfrow, Jeff Potter, Samuel D. Gosling: A Golden Opportunity: The Gold Rush, Entrepreneurship and Culture](https://docs.iza.org/dp14894.pdf)

Abstract:
We study the origins of entrepreneurship (culture) in the United States. For the analysis we make use of a quasi-natural experiment – the gold rush in the second part of the 19th century. We argue that the presence of gold attracted individuals with entrepreneurial personality traits. Due to a genetic founder effect and the formation of an entrepreneurship culture, we expect gold rush counties to have higher entrepreneurship rates. The analysis shows that gold rush counties indeed have higher entrepreneurship rates from 1910, when records began, until the present as well as a higher prevalence of entrepreneurial traits in the populace.

[Jun Yeong Lee, John V. Winters: Too Cold to Venture There? January Temperature and Immigrant Self-Employment across the United States](https://docs.iza.org/dp14941.pdf)

Abstract:
Immigrant entrepreneurs are critical to regional and national economies. Immigrants in the USA have higher self-employment rates than natives, and immigrants have made outsized contributions as founders of numerous highly successful firms. However, we document that immigrant self-employment rates vary considerably across areas of the USA. Our main measure is the percentage of immigrant workers in an area who are self-employed; i.e., the self- employment rate for the foreign-born. Areas with colder winter temperatures have especially low self-employment rates among their immigrant populations compared to other areas of the USA. This relationship holds for numerous sub-samples of immigrants and is not driven by any particular group. The relationship persists after controlling for numerous individual and local area characteristics. Immigrant entrepreneurs appear to be especially forward-looking and responsive to warmer January temperature as a locational amenity. The results have important implications about the location choices of immigrant entrepreneurs.

[Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Mark Koyama, Youhong Lin, Tuan-Hwee Sng: The Fractured-Land Hypothesis](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Fractured_Land.pdf)

Abstract:
Patterns of political unification and fragmentation have crucial implications for
comparative economic development. Diamond (1997) famously argued that “fractured
land” was responsible for China’s tendency toward political unification and Europe’s
protracted political fragmentation. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical
information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural
land to quantitatively gauge the effects of “fractured land” on state formation in Eurasia.
We find that either topography or productive land alone is sufficient to account for China’s
recurring political unification and Europe’s persistent political fragmentation. The existence
of a core region of high land productivity in Northern China plays a central role in our
simulations. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes and assess
how robust our findings are.
