<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Ever since the emergence of economics as a discipline, economists have been trying to provide an answer to what causes some countries to be poor and others rich. Are economies’ fates determined by their geographical endowments? Their culture? Their institutions? Why do some countries produce so much more output than others even under similar technical circumstances? What is the effect of globalization on development? What are the historical roots of contemporary economic performance? These questions occupy an increasing part of the agenda among growth and development economists. In this course we will study some of the answers that have been proposed to these and other questions. </p>
<p>The objective of the course is to introduce you to the frontier of research in the area of economic growth and comparative development. Additionally, it will introduce you to some of the necessary economic, computational, and mathematical tools to read, understand, and replicate the current academic research in this area. The course will give you the opportunity to learn to present and criticize other people’s ideas through presentations, replications and referee reports. Finally, the course will give you the opportunity to work on a research question of your own in this area.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>You will learn key models in economic growth and comparative development. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the frontier research done in the area of economic growth and comparative development. You will know the main theories and empirical facts. You will learn the basic skills for research in economics. Finally, you should be able to provide and test solve models for your research.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>The main textbook for the course is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unified-Growth-Theory-Oded-Galor/dp/0691130027">Unified Growth Theory</a> by <a href="odedgalor.virb.com">Oded Galor</a>. We will also use (working) papers and chapters from the Handbook on Economic Growth and other sources. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>We will learn some computational tools that are useful for research. For his purpose download and install the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Continuum Anaconda Python Distribution</a>. Also, learn some basic Python at <a href="http://codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy.com</a> and go over the Part I of Sargent and Stachurski’s <a href="http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html">Quantitative Economics (Python)</a>.</li>
